      <p>We are the introverted few looking to help each and every person with their search 
        for the most reliable sites for movies,TV series and anime. </p>
      <p>I, like most of you that find this page love a good tv series to binge and hate the 1 episode a week,
         so i used to search many different 
        websites to find my latest series,
         so i thought i would make it easier for others to find them by searching and logging them for you.
        quick access so your not spending your binge time on searches.
        
        we are going to be adding a booksite soon for those who wish for the writen word.
